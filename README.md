PROGRAM 3 -- LIGHTING AND SHADERS

Everything should work as described, except that I don't implement the correct Normal Matrix transformations for the Normals -- they are just modified by the ModelView Matrix instead.

I'd like to use the second of my late days as well, thanks.

./lighting [input mesh]

s - scale
t - translate
r - rotate
z - move light left
x - move light right

v - phong shading
b - gouraud shading
n - normal coloring

y - cycle through materials

q - quit
